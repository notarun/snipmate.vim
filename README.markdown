## snipMate

This is my personal fork of old [snipmate.vim](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate) plugin with some custom snippets and keybindings.
âš  Use at your own risk.

#### Install
```vim
Plug 'notarun/snipmate.vim'  # using vim-plug
```

#### Keybindings
```
<c-j>      => expand/forward
<c-k>      => backward
<c-x><c-x> => show available snippets
```

If you are looking for a well maintained fork have a look at [@garbas/vim-snipmate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate).
